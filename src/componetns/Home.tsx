            <Text fontWeight="bold">Logic:</Text> When you create a Piggy, you
            need to provide lock time data in the future. Then you can add some
            xEGLD amount to be locked till the lock date. For simplicity in the
            frontend app, all data is saved in the local storage, but you can
            always sync it with the Smart Contract. For now, after the payout,
            you would need to create another Piggy.
