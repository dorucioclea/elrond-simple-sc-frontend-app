### PiggyBank Smart Contract frontend app

PiggyBank is a custom Smart Contract on the Elrond blockchain. If you want to know more about preparing and deploying such a Smart Contract, check out separate [blog post](https://www.julian.io/articles/elrond-smart-contracts.html). Here we have a frontend app for it. 

**This app is for learning and demonstration purposes only.**

Hosted instance soon.

#### How to start with custom instance

1. Clone the repo
1. Remember to configure the .env file. Review and copy `.env.example` into `.env.local`
2. In `.env.local` configure your PiggyBank Smart Contract address. (Check how to deploy your custom one ([the link to the blog post](https://www.julian.io/articles/elrond-smart-contracts.html)), but you can also use the one from this repo (of course if the testnet isn't restarted yet)).
3. You would also need some xEGLD in on the testnet. There is one faucet which you can use: [https://r3d4.fr/elrond/testnet/](https://r3d4.fr/elrond/testnet/).
